Adding a README:
 - Create a file called `README.md`
 - touch README.md

Adding a .gitignore
 - touch .gitignore
 - commit it up

Authenication:
 - Git has removed authenticating your GitHub using your actual password
 - You will need to create a personal access token from GitHub to use as your password instead

Publishing an existing project to git:
 - If you have an existing project and want to publish it remotely to git without issues
 - when creating a remote repository in git. DO NOT INCLUDE '.gitignores' or 'README.md'. There's probably an easy way around this but for now just make a blank new remote repository. This is because  Adding .gitignores or a read me file will initialize a repo and commit. Meaning, pushing an existing repo to it will cause conflicts (I could be wrong on this completely but this is my understanding)
 - After a blank remote repository. In your project, you can initialize git and commit locally
 - You can as well change the main branch to whatever you want by typing:
	- 'git branch -M main' 
- You then need to add the remote repository you just created by typing
	- git remote add origin {url-to-repository}
	- You will be prompted to log in. Log in using your username and TOKEN stated above
- You now can push your existing project to the remote repository by typing
	- 'git push -u origin main'
	- NOTE: now since your local and remote are synced. You don't necessarily have to use '-u origin main' 
	- you are now in the main branch and can start creating branches locally but remember that your local branch is not in the remote and will need to include origin {branch name}
